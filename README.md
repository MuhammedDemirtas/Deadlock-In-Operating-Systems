# Deadlock Resolution Simulation

This Python-based program simulates deadlock scenarios and evaluates different algorithms to resolve them. It provides a comparative analysis of various algorithms' performance in handling deadlocks under different resource allocation strategies.

---

## Features

### Simulation Overview
- Simulates multiple processes competing for shared resources.
- Generates resource allocation requests using different distributions (Uniform, Normal, Custom).
- Implements several deadlock resolution algorithms.

### Deadlock Resolution Algorithms
- **Banker's Algorithm**: Checks for a safe state by simulating allocation requests.
- **Preallocation**: Frees resources preemptively based on process completion.
- **Timeout**: Releases resources if a process exceeds a set time limit.
- **Wait-Die**: Older processes wait while younger ones release resources.
- **Wound-Wait**: Older processes preempt resources from younger ones.

### Visualization
- Uses Matplotlib to plot the performance comparison of algorithms under various distributions and process counts.
- Clear, comparative graphs showing average resolution times.

## Example Usage

### Input Example
- **Resource Count**: 5
- **Process Count**: 50
- **Distribution**: Normal

### Output
- Average resolution time for each algorithm under the specified settings.
- Visualization of algorithm performance as line plots.

## Results
The program generates plots comparing the average resolution times of different algorithms under various conditions. For example:

- Banker's Algorithm performs well under balanced allocations.
- Timeout is faster for fewer processes but less efficient for high loads.
- Wait-Die and Wound-Wait demonstrate variable efficiency based on resource contention.
